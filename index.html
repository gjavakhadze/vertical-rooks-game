	It is a game played between two players who make moves in turns until one of them cannot make any move. The player who cannot make a move loses the game and the other player is declared the
	winner. The game is played on a board with rows and columns. The only pieces used in the game are rooks. A rook in HackerChess moves only vertically, which means that in never leaves a column to
	which it belongs. Moreover, in a single move, a rook moves through any number of unoccupied cells. Notice that there are no captures in HackerChess, two rooks cannot occupy the same cell, and a
	rook cannot jump over another rook. Each player has exactly one rook in each of the columns of the board.

	Given the initial position of the rooks and knowing that the second player makes the first move, decide who will win the game if both players play optimally.
